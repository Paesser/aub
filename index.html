In the past few months in this class I picked up a lot of important skills in contemporary and college writing, mainly in planned process work as compared to the traditional skills I previously had that tend to focus on a one-sided approach that is either the idea versus the picture or the picture versus the idea rather than how the idea melds into the picture. While planning my work, and following the writing packet I picked up a habit or two that improved my writing on paper during the latter half of the semester. I intend to keep these to ensure my success in future works. 

Mind mapping and freewriting were the two aspects that favored my writing process because I could quickly categorize ideas, draft paragraphs and focus on a key trait while maintain the flow of an essay. In the process of writing the analysis essay I was able write about the development of e-learning materials for children based on their individual needs as fast or assisted learners to better their intellectual growth during early childhood development. As I continue into my next class I feel this would help me narrow down on major attributes if ideas I am trying to represent much faster. 

While still on the initial stages of my writing, I found that having ideas that would answer a prompt more helpful than the brute force method that I had used before. I had to pause while coming up with ideas and develop more questions alongside those given to improve on the quality of argument I present in my essay. The topic I chose, on telecommunications and information technology, seemed quite abstract in the current events and the only fair thing to do was to create some form of controversy that would help me shed more light on the role it plays through the prompts provided in the assignment sheets. From my recent experiences these prompts help me maintain a straightforward argument or proposal whilst presenting my idea in the essay. 

Overall picked up a great deal when it comes to presenting my work to an audience by learning who to address and why I should address them in a manner different from a general audience. I also achieved a great respect for the constructive criticism that comes my way because I only aspire to bring out the best in my writing in every way. My sense of credibility has improved significantly and keeps improving in my writing and interactions, I am now able to hold better conversations both in person and in my papers.  </p>
